# ML_Trained_data_SUS
This repository includes object detection trained data for sustainability.

* The code still hasn't trained the data yet.
* After training, use the data to detect objects via a webcam.
* If everything works fine, find a way to publish the code to a raspberry pi. 

*** Committed the code for changing the workspace from home to dorm. ***
